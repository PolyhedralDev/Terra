### Pre-Request Checklist

<!--
  Please go through this checklist item by item and make sure you have successfully completed each of these steps.
    - You must be on the LATEST version of Terra to make sure your feature hasn't been added yet.
    - Make sure that there are no already existing feature requests similar to yours. (Including closed!) If you open a duplicate, it will be closed as such.
    - Make sure that this is actually in the scope of Terra.
    - Make sure that this is not a feature request that should be made for a specific Terra *pack*, and instead applies to all of Terra.
    - Make sure that you attach a copy of the latest.log file, if there are any exceptions thrown in the console.
      Putting *just* the exception IS NOT ENOUGH. We need to be able to check that there wasn't anything else before that caused it.
    
    You must put an x in all the boxes you have completed. (Like this: [x])
    
    To make sure that your issue is rendered properly, you may check the "Preview" tab (below the title) to see a rendered version of it before you submit it.
