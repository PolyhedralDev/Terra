## Pre-Issue Checklist

<!--
  Please go through this checklist item by item and make sure you have successfully completed each of these steps.
    - You must be on the LATEST version of Terra to receive any support. There is no support for older versions of Terra.
    - Make sure that this is not a *specific* compatibility issue with another terrain generation mod.
        Do not request *specific* compatibility with mods or plugins (e.g. "Compatibility with TechCraft v7").
        That should be implemented in an addon, **not** in the main project.
        *General* compatibility (e.g. "Ability to pull Vanilla/Modded features from parent biomes") will be considered in the main project.
    - Make sure that there are no already existing issues open with your problem. If you open a duplicate, it will be closed as such.
    - Make sure that it is actually Terra causing the issue, and not another mod/plugin.
        You can do this by testing to see if you can recreate the issue without Terra installed.
    - Make sure that this is not an issue with a specific Terra *pack* or Terra *addon*, and instead applies to all of Terra.
    - Make sure that you attach a copy of the latest.log file.
        Putting *just* the exception IS NOT ENOUGH. We need to be able to check that there wasn't anything else before that caused it.
    - Make sure that you have filled out all the required information and given descriptions of everything.
    
    You must put an x in all the boxes you have completed. (Like this: [x])
    
    To make sure that your issue is rendered properly, you may check the "Preview" tab (below the title) to see a rendered version of it before you submit it.
